# Boldly Going

I've been at "lie awake and think of the possibilities" level of excitement for [*Warp***Drive**](https://warp-drive.io) for about a year now.

For a long time I thought once the current arc of *Ember***Data**/*Warp***Drive**'s evolution was done it was time to pass the torch. That arc will conclude this year, but I'm not nearly done.

I had a clear vision of where I wanted it to go and how to get there. I knew it would take a long time. I figured that was a good swan song for me in OSS (I do have other things I love). But as that arc starts to wrap up, I'm finding that maybe the first decade was me just getting started.

I've been describing *Warp***Drive** as the first "DataFramework". A paradigm that stands in contrast to "Rendering Frameworks". It was silly to think that delivering the first DataFramework was going to be *the end*, but years ago the idea of kicking rendering frameworks aside was so out-there that what came after had little room to curate and grow.

But over the past few years, as we've ripped the covers off of *Ember***Data** and started exposing *Warp***Drive** to the universe I've been doing a lot less design work and a lot more implementation and documentation. This has had the funny effect of allowing space in my brain for seeds to be planted, watered, grow, die, rebirth, and grow again.

What started as a simple questions around "how do we make this more useful" "more approachable" and "more polished" have been allowed to turn into "what more could it do".

This has coincided nicely with my work at [AuditBoard](https://auditboard.com). When I joined AuditBoard I recognized it was a unique opportunity to join a company at the right size, the right growth trajectory, and the right problems at the right time for it in a way the perfectly aligned with the ideas I had, the problems I wanted to solve, and the time I was willing to give.

What I didn't anticipate was some of the deeper insights I'd gain from the technical challenges AuditBoard has faced, and how those insights would disagree with three of the larger trends in frontend technology over that time period: RSCs, SyncEngines, and AI Assisted Programming.

What I've come away with is a new understanding of what a great DataFramework needs to be, a new arc of exploration in the field of reactive programming: one I hope to be a part of for the next decade.
